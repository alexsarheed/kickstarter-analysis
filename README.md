## Overview of Project
Having almost reached the fundraising goal for this play, the project creator wanted to confirm whether this was a good or bad sign in terms of the potential success of the play. As a result, the outcome of a large pool of similar campaigns belonging to the same subcategory were analyzed for their launch dates and outcome. This report summarizes the results and trends derived from the dataset.

### Purpose
Derive a set of verifiable trends and statistically-verified tendencies of successful, failed, and cancelled campaigns in relation to the amount of money requested/raised.
